so I decided to have two ways of storing notes

In order to compile Java 9+ source, please set compileSdkVersion to 30 or above
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66449161/how-to-upgrade-an-android-project-to-java-11

https://developer.android.com/studio/write/java8-support
The Android Gradle plugin 3.0.0 and later supports all Java 7 language features and a subset of Java 8 language features that vary by platform version.

In order to compile Java 9+ source, please set compileSdkVersion to 30 or above
Affected Modules: capacitor-android, capacitor-community-sqlite, capacitor-cordova-android-plugins, capacitor-filesystem

To use an Android Emulator you must use an API 24+ system image. The System WebView does not automatically update on emulators. Physical devices should work as low as API 21 as long as their System WebView is updated.


Must compile to API 30 because capacitor is written in Java9+

Dependency 'androidx.coordinatorlayout:coordinatorlayout:1.2.0' requires libraries and applications that
      depend on it to compile against version 31 or later of the
      Android APIs.

      :app is currently compiled against android-30.

      Recommended action: Update this project to use a newer compileSdkVersion
      of at least 31, for example 33.

      Note that updating a library or application's compileSdkVersion (which
      allows newer APIs to be used) can be done separately from updating
      targetSdkVersion (which opts the app in to new runtime behavior) and
      minSdkVersion (which determines which devices the app can be installed
      on).


DEV:

npm run build
npx cap sync
npx cap open android
ionic cap run android  -l --external
   wait to select emulator
   you will seestarting development server


PRODUCTION:
npm run build
npx cap sync
npx cap open android
Build -> Build APK
